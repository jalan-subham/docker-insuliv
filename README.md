# Inspiration
The huge gap in healthcare facilities for diabetic patients in India.

# What it does
Allows every user to have access to an application which helps them keep their diabetes in check, without needing often visits to the doctor.

# How we built it
We built it using React Native on top of Expo Go. We are a team of four people, and one of us was handling everything, one was doing the front end, and the other two worked on the back end.

# Challenges we ran into
Bugs. BUGS THAT TOOK US 7 HOURS TO SOLVE.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
The application is almost complete. All of our APIs are working and the ML models are giving results. We are proud of our all-nighter.

# What we learned
All of us learnt how to work together in a team. It was a new experience for all of us, and all of us were exposed to a lot of different tech frameworks and learned how to work under pressure.

# What's next for Insuliv
We need to make it more polished and it might end up being a very usable and helpful app!
